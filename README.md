# RestAPI_Node_Mongo

Create a REST API With Node JS and Mongo DB

we construct a simple REST API using Node/Express, Mongo DB and deployed on Turbo 360. Along the way, we explore the key principles behind REST API design as well as common mistakes and scenarios that beginners often struggle with. Finally, we deploy our web service on the free Turbo 360 staging environment in conjunction with mLab for database hosting.
